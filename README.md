Angular quickstart
------------------

This is a quick run through of the 5 minute tutorial on the
[angular.io](http://angular.io) site. While I've spent some
time with TypeScript, the new annotation syntax will take
some getting used to. Also, not sure why I need the
`bootstrap` call - seems like something that could be
automatic. Some more research to do here. So far, not sure
that I'm feeling so great about Angular2.
